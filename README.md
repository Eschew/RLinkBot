# RLinkBot


Creator: Andrew

A python project that utilizes the PRAW API to construct a link parser bot. People who post reddit.com links as a comment on reddit will have it automatically parsed for the text data and posted as a reply. The point is to elminate extraneous clicking/loading of new web pages. 

Currently still in development. Will resume when I have time and after Reddit fully releases their new CSS standard.
